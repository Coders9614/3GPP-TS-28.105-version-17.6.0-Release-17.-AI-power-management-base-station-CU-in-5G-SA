3GPP TS 28.105 version 17.6.0 Release 17. AI power management base station (CU) in 5G SA


‚ö° Intelligent Energy Optimization for 5G SA Antenna Systems
This project focuses on reducing electrical energy consumption in 5G Standalone (SA) networks by dynamically managing antenna resources based on real-time user connectivity and traffic patterns. The system leverages AI-driven analysis of pilot signals and user distribution to optimize transmission power and antenna activation.


üéØ Core Objectives
User-Aware Antenna Control Monitor active user connections per antenna sector and dynamically adjust beamforming, transmission power, and antenna activation states.
Pilot Signal Intelligence Analyze 500+ pilot signals to infer spatial traffic density, signal quality, and user mobility trends. Use this data to guide antenna sleep/wake cycles.
AI-Driven Power Management Integrate Microsoft Azure AI and AWS cloud analytics to forecast load, predict idle periods, and optimize CU resource allocation.
Granular Energy Savings Implement techniques such as:
Symbol-level shutdown
Carrier aggregation-aware sleep modes
Deep sleep for underutilized sectors
Adaptive MIMO scaling based on user QoS
