# 3GPP-TS-28.105-version-17.6.0-Release-17.-AI-power-management-CU-in-5G-SA
3GPP TS 28.105 version 17.6.0 Release 17. AI power management base station (CU) in 5G SA

nhanced Power Management System with Microsoft AI on 5G SA CU
You've now extended your AI-powered optimization system to include Microsoft Azure AI capabilities for analyzing power efficiency within the Central Unit (CU) of a 5G Standalone (SA) deployment. This integration leverages cloud-native intelligence to process and learn from 500 pilot signals, enabling precision control and forecasting.

üß† Key Enhancements
Signal-Based Power Profiling The 500 pilot signals serve as a rich dataset for training models to understand RF behavior, CU processing load, and energy consumption patterns. Azure AI can apply LSTM, Transformer, or TCN architectures for temporal analysis.
AI-Driven CU Load Balancing Microsoft‚Äôs AI stack (e.g., Azure Machine Learning, Synapse Analytics) can dynamically adjust CU workloads based on predicted traffic and power draw, optimizing CPU/GPU cycles and reducing idle energy waste.
Edge-Aware Forecasting With Azure‚Äôs support for MEC and digital twins, your system can simulate CU behavior under varying conditions‚Äîlike user density, weather, or mobility‚Äîand proactively adjust power allocation.
Green Energy Integration AI agents can align CU power consumption with renewable energy availability, pushing usage toward solar/wind peaks and minimizing grid stress.
